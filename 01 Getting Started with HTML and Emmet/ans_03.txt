TAGS  --->
``````
In web development, tags are used to define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags 
are enclosed in angle brackets and provide instructons to the web browser on how to 
display and interpret the content. Tags are usually paired with an opening tag and a closing 
tag, with the content between them . 

Example :  <p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>

ELEMENTS --->

An element is made up of a combination of opening and closing tags along with the content 
in between. Elements define the various parts of a webpage such as headings, paragraphs, 
links, images, and more. Elements are the building blocks of HTML documents. 

Example :   <h1>This is a heading element</h1> 
            <p>This is a paragraph element containing some text.</p>

ATTRIBUTES --->

Attributes provide additional information about an HTML element. They are added within 
the opening tag of an element and are used to modify or customize the behavior, 
appearance, or other characteristics of the element. Each attribute has a name and a value, 
separated by an equal sign.

Example :   “href” is an attribute in <a> tag .
            “title” is an attribute in <p> tag .
